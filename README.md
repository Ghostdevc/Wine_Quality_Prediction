✅ Wine_Quality_Prediction

# Wine Quality Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts wine quality scores based on physicochemical properties using supervised machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Project Overview

- Loads the wine quality dataset
- Performs exploratory data analysis and feature selection
- Trains and evaluates classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Predicts wine quality as a classification task

## Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ghostdevc/Wine_Quality_Prediction.git
cd Wine_Quality_Prediction

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:
python main.py

## Dataset

- Wine Quality Dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
Includes features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, and a target variable: `quality` (score from 0 to 10)

## Features

- Data scaling and encoding
- Model selection and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
- Confusion matrix and feature importance visualization
